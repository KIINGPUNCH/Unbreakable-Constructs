# Unbreakable-Constructs

This mod simply adds most (non-functional) retextured vanilla blocks, that cannot be mined nor blown up

think of the time you tried mining bedrock

 

 

Specific use cases of this mod:
Used alongside Eureka! Ships! for Valkyrien Skies to create ships that cannot be destroyed* (helms can still be destroyed)
Avoid the use of plugins/area protection and instead use hard-coded hardness/resistance modifiers

 

Limitations:

This mod does not prevent other mods from manipulating the unbreakable blocks (such as Mine Mine no Mi devil fruit abilities converting other blocks to Ice, etc)
